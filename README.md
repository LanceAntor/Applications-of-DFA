DESCRIPTION: 
This program is about testing your knowledge through an engaging and interactive Quiz Game built using Python and the Tkinter library, enhanced with ttkbootstrap for a polished design. Players answer a series of quiz questions, managing their limited lives while attempting to get as many correct answers as possible. The game ends with a "GAME OVER" message if the player loses all three lives due to incorrect answers or the player answers all 10 questions. The game pulls its questions from an external file, allowing easy updates and customization of the quiz content.
